# Alice's Visited Countries

A hugo-based website listing which countries Alice has visited

Update country statuses in `data/countries.yaml`

## Changelog

Previous versions of this used Jekyll, but this was becoming increasingly difficult to keep working. While migrating to Hugo the page was completely redesigned to respect darkmode and show emojis for visited status. It's kinda ugly, but more functional and easier to maintain.

## Building Blocks
