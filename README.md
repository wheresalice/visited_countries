# Alice's Visited Countries

A hugo-based website listing which countries Alice has visited

Update country statuses in `data/countries.yaml`

## Changelog

- Added tools directory with a tool to show a diff of any missing/changed countries according to the official website
- Previous versions of this used Jekyll, but this was becoming increasingly difficult to keep working. While migrating to Hugo the page was completely redesigned to respect darkmode and show emojis for visited status. It's kinda ugly, but more functional and easier to maintain.
