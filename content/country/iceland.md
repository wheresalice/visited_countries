My first solo international trip was to Iceland. I did it to avoid Christmas, and I was woefully unprepared. It turns out everything actually did shut down in Reykjavik over Christmas, so it was just me and a few visiting students from China in the youth hostel. We had a single Cliff Richard CD to play, on repeat, whenever we were in the kitchen - which was most of the time because it got dark in the early afternoon.

But when we did adventure out it was truely magical, the park completely covered in snow and nobody else crazy enough to be out in the cold.

I returned the next summer to actually see some of the country, with a few days in Reykjavik and the rest in Akureyri enjoying the countryside. Summer is also beautiful, but not as magical as that first white Christmas.
