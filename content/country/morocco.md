## Marrakech

* Good, because of the lovely Hotel Riu Tikida Palmeraie with its beautiful gardens and pool and its amazing staff (I met people who were visiting for the 6th time)
* Good, because of the amazing Atlas mountains and the waterfalls and hikes 
* Bad, because Marrakech itself is all hustle and bustle with plenty of grifters trying to scam naive tourists

Would I go back? Probably, but I'd skip the city center and take more day trips into the mountains. And I'd do it in January again when it's not too hot
