We'd spent the past week traveling around the Balkans, primarily by train. We were running a little late due to heavy traffic.

It was late evening before we arrived into Pristina, we had a flight to catch at some ungodly hour of the early morning, and we were tired from so much traveling. We visited a cozy restaurant and then had a short walk through the town in the dark.

When we landed back in Germany we were greeted by armed police who checked everybody off the plane, to this day this is still the only time this has happened to me.

I need to return here some day and see the country properly.
