It had been a very long time since I last took some downtime somewhere warm near the sea. That's exactly what Crete provided, so I have very little to report from this country.

The tourist season runs April to October, and mid-October before school holidays is nice and quiet as well as not too hot for a stroll along the coast (easier said than done in the touristy areas) For longer walks, the E4 European Walking Path runs all the way from here to Spain; maybe one day...

The airport was fairly basic when I visited in 2022, with some very annoying announcements that people still somehow manage to miss.
