title: Canary Islands

My visit to the Canary Islands was back in the golden age of travel, circa 2016, when there were so many affordable flights from UK regional airports that it was ridiculous. You could fly from Leeds Bradford to Lanzarote and back for less than the taxi to the airport. So I did.

On the plane out the couple sat next to me asked "So how long are you visiting Lanzarote for?"

Two hours

Nobody else seemed to know or care. I had a nice quiet flight out, some time to people watch at the airport, and then flew home. This only counts as a visit because I did go through border control

Sadly this type of day trip doesn't seem likely to happen again any time soon, but maybe one day travel will be as cheap and easy as it was on that day in 2016
