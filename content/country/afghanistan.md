title: Afghanistan
---

When somebody asks if you want to go to Afghanistan you say yes, without question. Well it turns out maybe you should ask questions, because this trip was not with the best of people.

The foreign office advice gives specific areas that are a red-zone and therefore dangerous, but the reality of which areas are safe changes on a daily basis. So it's kinda important to have a guide here, particularly closer to the northern and eastern borders.
